I’m a third-year PhD student at [Università della Svizzera italiana (USI)](https://www.usi.ch/it) in Lugano, Switzerland, in the [People-Centered Computing Lab](https://pc.inf.usi.ch) led by [Professor Marc Langheinrich](https://pc.inf.usi.ch/team/langheinrich) and [Professor Silvia Santini](https://pc.inf.usi.ch/team/santini).

I work on **LLM security/privacy**, **Trustworthy ML**, **Federated Learning**, and **wearables**.
I also developed a wide range of interests in ubiquitous computing, with a general focus on healthcare.
Before joining USI I was working on wearable devices for cardiac care in UC San Diego.
